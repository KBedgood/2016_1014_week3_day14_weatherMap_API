### Objective:  
Create an app where a user can enter a city and get the 7 day forecast back.

### Mission:
Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API create an application that will allow users to enter a city and get back a 7 day forecast with a high and low and also an small image of the current weather. You can see the api docs at: https://openweathermap.org/forecast16 . This is a good intro assignment in interacting with an API and also reading API documentation.

When a user enters a city into a input box and hits enter, hit the API to get data back and display it.
Allow a user to keep entering cities and you should be clearing out the old data and replacing it. 
Use Bootstrap to format your layout.
